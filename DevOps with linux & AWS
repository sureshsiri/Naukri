linux Components:
The architecture of a Linux System consists of the following layers −(diagram)
Hardware layer − Hardware consists of all peripheral devices (RAM/ HDD/ CPU etc).
Kernel − It is the core component of Operating System, interacts directly with hardware, provides low level services to upper layer components.
Shell − An interface to kernel, hiding complexity of kernel's functions from users. The shell takes commands from the user and executes kernel's functions.
Utilities − Utility programs that provide the user most of the functionalities of an operating systems.

There are different types of Shell programs(or)interpretors are available?
-bourne shell(sh)
-korn shell(ksh)
-bourne again shell(bash)
-C Shell(csh)
-TENEX/TOPS Cshell(tcsh).


What are the features of the Linux operating system?
1.Portable=it can run across any hardware platforms
2.Open Source=It can be used freely and the source code is also freely distributed and freely modifiable
3.Multi-User/Multi-Programming operating system=Multiple users can use the linux operating at the same time and can share the underlying hardware resources of the computer like RAM,CPU,HDD etc.
4.Hierarchial Filesystem=There is only one single root for the Filesystem of the linux
5.Shell=a special interpreter program that runs on top of the kernal helping the users to interact with the linux Kernal
6.6.Highly Secured=There are various different levels of security is provided by the Linux operating system
-user authentication
-data encryption
-access control restrictions on
-User Process.

What are virtual machines?
................two machines in one -----
what is hypervisor?

*#1 Bios->Enable virtualization
why Oracle Virtual-Box?
.......vagrant.....

why file system format?

What is File systems?
windows:-
-FAT stands for File Allocation Table=is suitable for storage devices of moderate size(1gb maxfile)
-NTFS=New technology File System

linux file systems:-

Linux operating system uses File System technics for storing and organizing the physical storage device memory.The linux file system uses hierachial model.
Linux supports multiple File System Types:
1.Ext (EXTENDED FILE SYSTEM).
2.Ext2
3.Ext3
4.Ext4(*default filesystem)
5.JFS
6.XFS
7.Btrfs

What are the standard directories that comes as part of the Linux Filesystem?
/
"/"-is the root/parent of the Filesystem
|-1.bin=core commands of linux are placed here(shell command cat/sh/ls)
|-2.boot=boot loader files are located
|-3.dev=all the external devices are mounted like usb and dvd
|-4.etc=The installed Software packages related configuration files are kept in this directory
|-5.home=For each linux user there is a home directory created under/home/$USER,he has only access to the contents of his home directory only(by default)
|-6.lib=libraries of installed software packages are placed here,so that these can be shared across
|-7.media=all the media devices like musicplayers,usb sticks etc are mounted here
|-8.mnt=external storage devices like network drives,mount volumes are mounted here
|-9.opt=optional software packages are located under/opt directory(package managers)
|-10.proc=Linux treats everything as a file,Even a program under execution which is called process is also represented as a file in Linux operating system,to keep track of its running information.and all these process files are stored/kept in/proc
|-11.root=root user home directory
|-12.sbin=super user bin directory,here all the commands that can be executed by super user are available.
|-13.tmp=/tmp contains all the temporary files which will be automatically deleted for every system reboot
|-14.usr=the utilities are files that has to be shared across the users of the linux are placed in usr.
|-15.var=system logs and variable data files are kept here
Note:-you might find additional directories if you see in your linux install,this differs based on the linux distro you are using.
